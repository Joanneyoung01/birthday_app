Post-Challenge 2: Birthday App
Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

1. Wish the user happy birthday
2. Tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

Proposed screens:
Here are some suggested screens, but feel free to change the content, style and flow to make it your own.

Homepage - Ask for Name, Date, Month, Submit 
           name, date, month, submit

Outcome - If birthday, wish "Happy birthday"
          "It's your birthday in x days"
